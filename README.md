# metaTSPstu

Implementation in Julia (compliant v1.0.0) of well-known optimization algorithms applied on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for pedagogical purposes.

This implementation is the base of an exercice of the course "metaheuristics".

Algorithms :

- VNS (skeleton)
- TS (minimal full implementation)
